## Inspiration

In our team, we used to have a member who knew the Python programming language, but didn't know anything at all about the basic tools that was like common knowledge to the rest of us. 
We knew how frustrating it was seeing our young team member struggle, but not being able to do anything because we've long since forgotten how we learned it.
So, we built Hack N Go, for our young team member as a way to give back to our new hacker and hackers abroad.

## How we Built it

Using Domain.com and mkdocs, a tool designed for creating websites aimed towards guides and documentation, we've managed to build a hosted website that has a few tutorials and guides that are aimed towards the new hacker community. 
We decided to use the principle of VARK (Visual, Auditory, Reading, Kinesthetic) in our guides in order to address the need of hackers who have different learning styles.

## Challenges we ran into

It was our first time using Domain.com and we couldn't get the domain DNS record set up correctly. 
Try as we might we couldn't figure it out until we contacted the support group and they helped us out.
As I was not the only one who had this problem, it felt a bit humbling to see that there are so many things that we just 
don't know but are there for grabs.

## What we learned

We learned that the authors of almost all open source guides and tools have had a lot of work in front of them when first starting to write their guides and documentation. 
It was a humbling experience as we got to see how hard it was to write so much in detail and clarity that we developers often take for granted. 

## Whatâ€™s next for Hack 'n Go

We want to extend the guides and flesh them out, if you will, with more details and guides for beginner hackers. 
We understand that our ambitious goal of writing guides out from scratch was too expensive in terms of time. 
We beat ourselves by the foot because of it and we hope that this MVP is a testament to what will become. 
Overall, the final website will feature fully fledged guides with multiple versions of those guides, each addressing a young hacker's learning method.
