# The Problem
We want more Terminal Zoomers
People who can live in their command line

but it just isn't that easy for everyone
Every day, begginers struggle to get through documentation.

In a better world, there would be a central hub of documentation, where Terminal Zoomers can live and breathe in their command line without churning through several websites

Well, thank god we live in a better world!
Introducing Hack N Go!


# The Problem
Beginner hackers in this day and age have skill deficits compared to their
fellow hackers who are more knowledgeable, experienced and battle hardy.

Simply searching up Github resource lists and medium articles just isn't enough
for a beginner hacker to learn effectively.

Why should YOU spend hours finding the “BEST” way to learn something? Or spend
DAYS “catching up-to-speed” with the other hackers?

Also, many people have different learning styles which is not always addressed in these websites, so how do you deal with that?

That's where we come in. [insert commercial music here]


# Solution

Hack N Go is a curated list of guides to get you up-to-speed and was designed for the average hackathon newbie.

[insert website screen recording]

As you can see here, we have mutitple guides for the new hacker. We have intros to Discord, Devpost, hackathons, git, commandline even heroku. To address the problem of different learning styles, we have tabs in each document that addresses each learning style our hackers might have: Reading, Auditory, and Project based

So step up and stand shoulder-to-shoulders of hackers.
