Hackathons, CTFS, and HackCons.

You might be thinking to yourself, What the heck is a hackathon? Sounds scary, right? Don't worry, it's not that type of hacking.

Over the last few months, hackathons have taken the world by storm.

You might have seen one such hackathon in your school or online in Devpost, more on that later, but it's not what you think it is.

No, we don't break into school computers or mainframes. Yes, we do drink redbull and stay hunched over our laptops, pulling all-nighters, and sleeping on the cold ground

> Hackathons provide a venue for self-expression and creativity through technology. People with technical backgrounds come together, form teams around a problem or idea, and collaboratively code a unique solution from scratch â€” these generally take shape in the form of websites, mobile apps, and robots.

Simply put, you can think of hackathons as like a startup generator.

A place to share ideas or solutions to problems and present them under a time pressure.

Let's dive right into the few differences between these three categories.

=== "Kinesthetic"

    Join a hackathon, often times, the best way to learn is by going out and doing it.

    Learn from experience, that's how we all did it. We didn't have any of those fancy guides on how to start, we sorta knew what to expect.

    Your mission is to join a hackathon, just for the experience of joining them, you don't have to participate in them if you don't want to.

## Joining a Hackathon

We'll be talking about hackathons specifically in this guide as they are abundant in number and they have great prizes to grab.

There are a few places to find hackathons, some of the best places we've are at Devpost, MLH.io, HackerEarth and HackerLeague.

These places are all websites that lists hundreds of event hackathons that you can join for free and submit projects to.

They're wonderful places because they have the dates of each event hackathon, an image of the hackathon which describes the theme of the hackathon, and the prize pool of the hackathon.

Now, once you've picked a hackathon that you're willing to do, you can head over and find a place to chat and ask any questions.

Usually, this place is on a social media platform like Discord or Slack.

So, we'll help you in creating a Discord or Slack account and first steps that you might want to do.
