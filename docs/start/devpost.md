Devpost is a website designed for organizations, event organizers, and hackers like you.

It's meant to help hackathons, from which hackers can join and participate in them.

Over the past few months, this quarantine has nearly doubled the usage of Devpost as a repository for event hackathons.

Here, you can find multitudes of hackathons ranging in difficulty from beginner to professional.

We'll discuss two things you need to know in order to interact with Devpost.

## How to find Hackathons

Finding hackathons is the bread and butter of Devpost.

Once you've signed up for an account on Devpost, via email or github account, you can view the list of hackathons posted and updated every few seconds.

Here, you can scroll down and click on a card and look at the event details.

Looking at the event details, you can see a few things, the title, tabs right below the banner, a little background behind the event, a few buttons, prizes that have or have not been announced, eligibility, requirements, etc.

It's important you read through all of these, especially the eligibility, the requirements for a submission and the judging criteria as these will determine whether or not you can enter and win a prize.

From here, you can click the green button at the top to join the hackathon and fulfill the task list they provide you, look at the participants, submissions, and any updates.

It's important you understand the hackathon and what they expect of you when you participate.

Next, you'll need to go to the participants tab or their communications platform they provide you and direct message some folks who are looking for a team.

## How to submit projects

When the time comes, you'll be tasked with entering in your final project via Devpost. If you've registered for the event and the event started, you should see the green button again on Devpost that says 'start submission'.  Click that and upload any pictures, videos that you might have and explain what you did and how you did it in text.

A **good** submission has the following:

- At the top:

    - **A catchy motto**

    - **A catchy title**

- A 2-3 minute video that demos the project and explains why you did it

- 3-4 images of the project

- In the text portion:

    * You should have these as headings:

        - **Inspiration**

        - **What it does**

        - **How we built it**

        - **Challenges we ran into**

        - **Accomplishments that we're proud of**

        - **What we learned**

        - **What's next**

        - **Built with** (here you list the languages and tools you used)

        - **Try it out**
