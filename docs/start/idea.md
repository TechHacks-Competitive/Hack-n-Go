For a hackathon or for any startup, you need an idea.

An idea is a powerful thing, it can bring people towards you, and it can win you prizes.

So don't treat an idea as something useless, it is important as some may say. However, what most don't tell you is *how* you're supposed to create ideas.

Idea creation is very simple. If you're given a theme, even better. But, if you're not or you're unsure, that's perfectly fine.

## The Twilight Zone

This is what I like to call our way of creating ideas. It's *way* different from the show, but there are a few similarities.

The Twilight Zone is a mysterious zone much comparable to day dreaming. In that zone, ideas flow to you from every facet of your daily life.

I don't have to tell you that forcibly coming up with ideas may result in garbage, but, in the Twilight Zone, all ideas are good.

It just depends on your imagination. So try it out right now. Try and relax as much as possible and stare at the ceiling or out of your window.

You'd be suprised at how many ideas you can think up.

Once you've come up with ideas, you can try to use our guide below of seeing if your idea will win.

### Base your ideas in reality

Here are some of our points that we try to base our ideas on

* **Something that solves a problem,**

* **Something that advances a solution.**

* **Something that is new.**

* **Something that is presentable.**

These 4 are all criteria that we hackers base our ideas on. **It's like a secret criteria that we all know but don't really know**, so don't try to ask about this, they'll be confused.
