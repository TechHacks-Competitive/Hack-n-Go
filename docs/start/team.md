## Finding a team
There are a few ways to get a team before a hackathon.

One way is to find people on social media and reach out.

These places can be from anywhere as long as they fit the age limit in hackathons.

They can be from Stack Exchange, Stack Overflow, and Quora.

Start with your own network of friends and like-minded acquaintances.

You can also find other hackers on meetups and developer groups.

Further, hackathons conducted on platforms like HackerEarth allow participants to form teams on the platform itself.

So, start your hunt early. It does you no good to diddle on finding a new team during the hackathon.

=== "Kinesthetic"

    I recommend you see this website for how to create a team in small chunk sized steps, if you're a kinesthetic learner

=== "Visual"

    If you're more of a visual guy like I am, and you love The Office, you'll love this. This will tell you what team building is all about

## Work on your pitch

Most oftenly, in big hackathons, you'll find people who'll join but only because of the idea and that's a shame because those people usually have the best skills.

Like they always say, like-minded people tend to flock together.

So work on your pitch, if you were to sell someone an imaginary papercup in the elevator, what few things could you say that would make them want to buy it?

Maybe it has multiple features, maybe it's something revolutionary. That's what you need.
