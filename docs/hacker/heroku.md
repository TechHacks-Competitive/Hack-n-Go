### The Beginning 

Well, for starters, it would probably help to have an account

visit [https://signup.heroku.com/](https://signup.heroku.com/) and create an account.

After that, you'll probably want to download the Heroku and Git CLIs

A CLI, or Command Line Interface, is a way for you to call certain commands from your terminal.

### Download Guide

#### Windows

[64 Bit installer](https://cli-assets.heroku.com/heroku-x64.exe)

[32 Bit installer](https://cli-assets.heroku.com/heroku-x86.exe)

#### Mac
Since you should already have homebrew and git installed, all you have to do is type:

> brew install heroku/brew/heroku
